[{"content":"Ever since I caught a glimpse of the elegant PaperMod theme of Hugo static site builder, I knew I got to use it. While PaperMod theme is very slick and fast it has a few minor drawbacks, which need to be addressed.\nOne of them being wrong height of the title page when navigation element is wrapped. This looks kinda cumbersome mainly on mobile devices, where, the page is just too high when no content is shown. Footer on the following image is out of the view: Here we have it fixed: Fix In PaperMod many theme variables are hardcoded to css file, such as header and footer heights.\n:root { ... --gap: 24px; --header-height: 60px; --footer-height: 60px; --theme: rgb(255, 255, 255); ... While this makes modifications nice and simple, the problem materializes itself when children of the header are wrapped to the next line. This suddenly doubles the real header height without informing anyone else. Therefore, The page is suddenly 60px higher and scrollbar is displayed.\nFix is simple, we introduce new theme variable --header-height-multiplier which will be set to the number of lines the header is wrapped into. We also need to apply this change to all usages of --header-height.\n/*main.css*/ .main { min-height: calc(100vh - var(--header-height-multiplier, 1) * var(--header-height) - var(--footer-height));} /*profile-mode.css*/ .main .profile { min-height: calc(100vh - var(--header-height-multiplier, 1) * var(--header-height) - var(--footer-height) - (var(--gap) * 2));} Notice the usage of second argument 1 in var(). This value will be used if the one before it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist yet.\nFinally, to change the multiplier value we use Javascript.\nvar detectWrap = function (parentID) { var prevItem = {}; var currItem = {}; var items = document.getElementById(parentID).children; for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; items.length; i++) { currItem = items[i].getBoundingClientRect(); if (prevItem \u0026amp;\u0026amp; prevItem.top \u0026lt; currItem.top) return true; prevItem = currItem; }; return false; } var onResiz = function (event) { // wrapping-header id needs to be added to the header in header.html document.documentElement.style.setProperty(\u0026#39;--header-height-multiplier\u0026#39;, detectWrap(\u0026#39;wrapping-header\u0026#39;) ? 2 : 1); }; window.onresize = onResiz; document.addEventListener(\u0026#39;DOMContentLoaded\u0026#39;,onResiz, false); Here we are essentially checking, if all children share the same y-position (top). If not, items are wrapped, and we set multiplier to 2. (It would be possible to add support for even higher values but why bother.)\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! One more step towards perfection!\n","permalink":"https://cooble.github.io/posts/2022-06-02-hugo-height-fix/","summary":"Ever since I caught a glimpse of the elegant PaperMod theme of Hugo static site builder, I knew I got to use it.

Anyway some improvements were made.\nNew Language selector screen was added. Translator and UTF-8 First big thing is Translator which is simple static class that offers method translate(String\u0026amp; key)(obviously). Usually it\u0026rsquo;s good thing to separate strings that are shown to user from strings in source code, preferably store them in some .txt file. Also adding another language is as simple as adding another lang file and registering the language in code.\nFor example play button will get it\u0026rsquo;s string not as \u0026quot;Play\u0026quot; but as ND_TRANSLATE(\u0026quot;btn.play\u0026quot;) which converts the universal key to it\u0026rsquo;s mapped value in current lang file. I have stolen the translator code from my old Java Game ChristmasGameAdventure. Lang format allows comments as well as wrapping nested key names. For example # only line comments are allowed // this is also line comment -\u0026gt;main.btn play=Play settings=Settings exit=Quit \u0026lt;- btn.start=Start Me will expand to:\nmain.btn.play=Play main.btn.settings=Settings main.btn.exit=Quit btn.start=Start Me Not quite sure whether the wrapping of nested keys is really that useful but let\u0026rsquo;s leave it for now.\nNext thing is utf-8 support. This is necessary since nearly all languages require some special non-ascii characters, which don\u0026rsquo;t fit in one byte. Lang files are already utf-8 encoded so I added method to convert utf-8 encoded std::string to std::u32string where each character really coresponds to one glyph. Also modified Font and FontParser to work with decoded std::u32strings. Everything for Hiero (Hiero font converter tool is a software I use to generate the .fnt and .png files in res/fonts directory. This program requires TrueTypeFont and list of to-be-included characters. It generates atlas .png of all glyphs and .fnt file containing uv coords of said glyphs.)\nAfter adding translator and utf-8 support I wanted to test it with some languages. English was working already so I started with my native tongue: Czech. I draw all the ěščřžýáíé.. glyphs to andrew_font.ttf). Then opened Hiero, set the font and specified all the required glyphs to output. Chars in game visible, no problem. The reason why I\u0026rsquo;m describing each step is that the next language to add was Japanese. Obviously I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to draw every japanese character to adrew_font so I went with very nice japanese font umeboshi. Ok next step is to open Hiero, load font aaaand specify all the required characters\u0026hellip;\nWell that was certainly a problem since there is no way I\u0026rsquo;m going to fit all the 5918 glyphs in the font by hand and also there is no way to fit such number of glyphs to one png file. So I would need to pick only the most frequently used ones. If only there was a list of those\u0026hellip; Guess what! ImGui to the rescue. ImGui::GetIO().fonts.getJapaneseRanges() returns about 2000 most used glyphs. Nice so I wrote a function ImGui::FontRangeToUTF16(ImWchar* ranges) to return those glyphs as an utf-16 encoded string which can be saved to file from which I can copy it to Hiero. Aaand done.\nIntegration of Chrome profiler Since I noticed some sudden fps drops (up to 90ms per tick) I decided to inspect it using profiler. But BPE (Better Profiler Experience) was needed! (translated: The old one sucked) Current engine profiler saves data to .json file. In the past to view the json it was necessary to open Chrome, write url chrome://tracing then hit button load and pick which .json file to open. No more! Added wonderful integration of Chrome profiler. In Telemetrics window new button added to begin/end profiling and button to open Chrome with already finished profiling session. That means no more annoying load button clicking and searching through the goddamn filesystem to find that one .json file.\nTechnically it was done like this: Copied chrome://tracing html and js file to \u0026lsquo;/res/tracing/\u0026rsquo;. Modified html to include another js file called currentProfileTemp.js. Modified original tracing.js to load json string specified in second js file after document load. This was neccessary due to security issues with js being forbidden to read any files not specified directly by user in some file dialog. When OpenLastProfile button is hit in game, game copies profile json data to currentProfileTemp.js and then opens index.html with chrome. script in tracing.js reads json file in curProfTemp.js file \u0026hellip; And done. Ain\u0026rsquo;t that magnificient.\n(In the end I found the culprit of the 90ms peaks: glMapPointer() during particle render. No clue how to fix it though\u0026hellip;yet)\nAuto BlockDig and other stuff When the pickaxe is held in hand and mouse is held, Pickaxe automatically finds block in view to dig, renders gui block selector to show which block will be dug and digs it (corners of block periodically change to simulate block damage)\nEl Pickaxo was added (OP pickaxe with veery fast digging speed) Added trash slot to players inventory Added wooden armor and armor slots Player useItemActions are controlled by items; not by WorldLayer anymore.

To put it simply there were few requirements:\nPlay music = sound file isn\u0026rsquo;t loaded into memory all at once (That would take looong time), instead it fills the buffer and after a part is consumed and played new data is inserted to the buffer from file, yeah, stream in the nutshell.. Play sound and cache it = It would be a pain to load sound every time one requests to play the same audio. If I had a machine gun (e.g. S.D.M.G) for example just imagine how many times the same .ogg file would need to be opened and read from at once! That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s important to store a decoded version of sound for later use if neccessary. When there is no more space we just drop the sound buffer which is not used. Functions like setVolume, fadeIn, fadeOut, setSpeed/setPitch (same thing for now) and loop. Spatial sound - the farther away the radio is, the lower the volume. The more to the left the radio is, the lower the volume on the right channel And I also added AudioHandle to interact with instead of command like methods of class Sounder (best naming ever).

To use it to interact with the engine and with a world eventually, I needed to register and hook some C++ methods to be accessible by lua. I immediately added ND_INFO() to print messages using native lua lib. So far so good. Then I realized that\u0026rsquo;s too much of the work and that I would use some third-party libs that would bridge that gap for me.\nAnd with the biggest tool in the shed I went: SWIG.(Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator). It generates C++ files called e.g. classname_wrapper.cxx or something. special method in those files needs to be called and then you have working lua-c++ interface Yay\u0026hellip;\nFor a while my desire was satisfied. Then I though about some more simple or elegant method (which was the begging of the end (my end)). I searched and found luabind, an awesome library that seems to provide simple interface to easily bind classes to lua as well (btw SWIG can do that too). I tried to compile it with the engine but compiler was so nice and politely informed me that I hadn\u0026rsquo;t read the READMEs.\nWell this lib seems to need a Boost?. That was actually my first encounter with the vast library of libraries so I naively thought I could just include it in my project and guess what\u0026hellip; It didn\u0026rsquo;t work. Up to this day I still haven\u0026rsquo;t find a way to successfully import it (\u0026ldquo;one day I swear I will beat you!\u0026rdquo;). With this option out of the way I tried the deboostified version of luabind for which the linker found the courage to tell me about his inability to found some symbol definition which I was deeply sure was happily contained in one cpp file. And so I dropped the idea of using luabind completely\u0026hellip; Farewell.\nIn the end after possibly 1 week of trials and errors I settled with an incredibly simple lib LuaBridge that doesn\u0026rsquo;t need anything and uses templates. What a great adventure! LuaBridge helped me to bind glm::vectors to lua as well as method World::spawnParticle() and with that I could finally make a loop and spawn as many goddamned particles as I wanted.

You know, I was feeling festive and had a great deal of free time on my hands, so why not put my creativity into good use. My hopes, that I could put it under my Xmas tree, were mercilessly crushed, though.\nWriting the story, drawing all textures, dubbing the whole thing and coding the game engine itself had rendered itself not to be as straightforward as my young and feeble mind expected (surprisingly). After sudden realization (on 24th) that I\u0026rsquo;d unable to finish that madness in time I stashed the project and forgot about it. Nevertheless, thanks to a game jam sort of competition on ITNetwork Summer 2017 I found a freshly burning courage to revive my inner strength to work on it again and this motivation in the end won me a 2nd place at the competition. Hurray.\nREADME Simple point-and-click adventure game written in Java.\nCurrently, only first episode of the game is out. (available in GitHub Releases) Estimated playtime: 1+ hrs. Game achieved 2nd place at event ITNetwork Summer 2017 (In Czech). Walkthrough is available on YouTube. Have you ever wonderered, what would happen if Santa got kidnapped? No? Well, that\u0026rsquo;s sad but that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what happens, and it\u0026rsquo;s up to the player to figure out the identity of the criminal as well as to save Santa\u0026hellip; and Xmas I guess.\nCurrent Episodes: Santa\u0026rsquo;s missing Who knows? (like I really don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue) Story Player is invited for yearly Christmas party with Santa at the North Pole. At the Santa\u0026rsquo;s cottage everybody is dancing to the Christmas carolls under the lights of mutlicolored reflectors when suddenly\u0026hellip;\nLights go out, panic bursts out, and when the lights are back up, the most important person is missing.\nProject structure Uses Slick2D graphics engine.\nEverything is working and ready to be extended, commented, and maybe to add even new episodes. No external dependencies are required. Everything is contained in lib folder.\nProject consists of 3 modules:\nCoobleEngine Engine which manages all low level stuff, provides locations, resource loaders etc. Parses custom locations from xml files ChristmasGameV2 Content of the game itself, is dependent on the Engine. contains xml files for locations as well as custom Locations.java (items entities\u0026hellip;) contains all resources (audio, textures, dialogs \u0026hellip;) CoobleSandpit Graphical editor that generates xml files for locations. Generates all static content from placing items in locations to writing branching dialog constant Loc.SRC_FOLDER stores game resource folder, defaultly is set to ChristmasGameV2 More info At first, I started writing the game in JavaFX, let\u0026rsquo;s just say that it\u0026rsquo;s possibly not the optimal solution\u0026hellip; During development, I became so lazy that I wrote a level editor to create more game content easily. I wrote an algorithm for entity navigation in location (finding path from A to B), so now the hero can solve any maze without players help. Or it can walk around a table. :D Game contains simple branching dialog system, where player can pick from various questions to find out more about Santa\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate fate. Inventory is overloaded with all the items that could be useful. You can save Santa in 1280/720 or in Fullscreen. Textures have a resolution of 320/180. That\u0026rsquo;s not a lot I know. Btw. the first version was in 160/90. All textures drawn in GIMP (by me, unfortunately).
